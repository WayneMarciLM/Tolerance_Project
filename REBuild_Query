Ok now I have the following query: 
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM calendar_date), 'FM00') || TO_CHAR(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM calendar_date), '9999') AS Month_Year,
    facility_code,
    AVG(ttl_seats) AS average_seats,
    AVG(CAD_RENTABLE_SF) AS average_rsf  -- Replace AVG with MIN or MAX as needed
FROM 
    HRDW.REAL_ESTATE.REAL_ESTATE_BUILD
WHERE 
    facility_code = '0055' 
    AND status_description = 'Active'
GROUP BY 
    TO_CHAR(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM calendar_date), 'FM00'), 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM calendar_date), 
    facility_code
ORDER BY 
    Month_Year;


I want to add in a new column "hybrid" which is a count of hybrid employees.  A little more info about this table is that not only does it have multiple date values per month but it has many rows per individual date.  The table has a column cost_center which are organizational breakdowns within a facility_code for each date.  Each cost_center has a breakdown of how many hybrid employees report to that facility_code for that date.  I need to capture one date within each month and take the sum of the hybrid employees for that individual date within that month to get an accurate count of employees for that facility_code for that date.
